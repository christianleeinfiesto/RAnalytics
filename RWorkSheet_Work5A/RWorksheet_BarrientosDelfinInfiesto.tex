This is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever, and it consistently improves as it progresses.The Journeys of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are unforgettable. These are some of the best-written characters to ever come from a pen-hitting paper.My praises for the acting and cinematography are unending. Some of the shots are intricate works of art, and I was rarely distracted by the acting. The performances are excellent to the extent that it feels improper to refer to them as performances.Overall, Breaking Bad consistently maintains a level of engagement and technical quality seen in only the best of movies, and in terms of tone, every intense moment is executed with excellence and always achieves the impact it reaches for.I feel like the show's plot in the early seasons lacks a certain level of complexity due to it not having a vast amount of plot threads, and the start is a bit slow-paced, but Breaking Bad is an absolute must-watch. If you have mixed feelings towards Season 1, trust me, it is only uphill from there.If there was ever a series you could call perfect, I think this might be it.

The characters are well developed and entertaining. The show ties everything together very neatly. It's honestly a show that get's better each time you view it. It's cathartic to see Walter break bad and how the story unravels is the best way it could have. Very good storytelling, well done to Vince Gilligan.

I know that people say that about a ton of different shows but Breaking Bad really is universally thought of as one of the greatest shows of all-time. All you have to do is go google "greatest tv shows of all-time" and I guarantee you that it's at or near the top of every list you'll find and there's a reason for that...because it is!

It's easily one of my favorites shows of all-time and one of the best shows in the history of television. Just read through the reviews and look at the 9.5 rating to see how loved this show really is. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special. I love this show so much that I've already watched it all the way through twice already and plan on doing so again sometime in the near future. There's nothing more I can say about this incredible show that hasn't already been said so just go watch it. But plan ahead to give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge this as quickly as you can. It's addicting once you start!

We all are lucky enough to be born to watch series like this.

The first few seasons were incredible but I feel that they dragged it out too long. As the weeks go by I found myself thinking "really, there are 5 seasons of this". I am truly diverse in my tastes and don't get offended very easily at all. I love gore, gritty, sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, romance, animation. You get the picture I really do not discriminate and instead judge on it's merits. But I found that Breaking Bad exhausted me. Five seasons of disgusting, corruption, ferralness, deplorable human behaviour took it's toll on my level of appreciation for this show. If it had been shorter I would have enjoyed it more. I know it was revolutionary and truly realistic but in the end I despised it for being great and the fact that I had to see it through to the end.I know people will think I am mad for writing this but does a show that is fantastic but sucks the soul and heart out of you make for as good TV as everyone believes; or was everyone else too caught up in the hype to admit their true feelings about Breaking Bad.
## 13 'Breaking Bad' is one of the most popular rated shows on IMDb, is one of those rarities where every season has either been very positively received or near-universally acclaimed critically and where all of my friends have said nothing but great things about.Very few shows in recent memory had me so hooked from the very start that before the week was over the whole show had been watched, especially when for a lot of shows now airing watching one episode all the way through can be an endeavour. 'Breaking Bad' had that effect on me, and its reputation as one of the best, consistently brilliant and most addictive shows in many years (maybe even ever) is more than deserved in my eyes. Its weakest season is perhaps the first season, understandable as any show's first season is the one where things are still settling.Actually everything is established remarkably from the very start, but once the writing and characterisation becomes even meatier the show reaches even higher levels.Visually, 'Breaking Bad' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.The writing for 'Breaking Bad' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The direction couldn't be better.Can't say anything bad about the acting. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal as one of the most fascinating anti-heroes, or even of any kind of character, in either film or television. Aaron Paul has never been better and Anna Gunn is affecting. The characters are compelling in their realism.Overall, describing it as brilliant doesn't do 'Breaking Bad' justice. 10/10 Bethany Cox

A really REALLY good fever dream. The directing is absolutely perfect. The characters bounce off each other in this really well done way. I can really feel the true emotion and pure character coming from each one. I can feel the greed, lust, money hunger animals each of these characters are. There are no true heroes in this story (except hank I love u).

Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that, either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.The show plays like the daydream fantasy of any underachieving, struggling middle class family man who's had to bury all his dreams (I mean: who wouldn't want to be a meth-kingpin for a little while?), before it turns into a nightmare. One could almost say that 'Heisenberg' is Walter White's 'Tyler Durden'(for those who don't get the reference: watch 'Fight Club' - you won't regret it).For pure entertainment value, this is simply the best show I've ever seen. Every single one of the main characters has already reached the status of a screen icon - when does that ever happen?! Most fun I've ever had watching a TV-show and an instant classic.

Nothing comes close.I may currently be on my 20th dose of this show and it's still as addictive and beautiful as the first time.

It should be the greatest but they failed miserably in the finale season especially the last 3 (mainly the finale) episode.Writers need to take notes and be more like breaking bad. They had they ending planned out from the begging. They didn't try and build a massive brand or following behind the show and extend their seasons to do so. They stuck with their plan and created the greatest show we may ever see.Thank you for existing.

And I've seen a lot of shows. The setting, character development and the actors... everything is pitch perfect. I'm on my fourth run through this show and I still love it. There's no other show out there I can watch this many times and still be excited. The dynamic between Walter and Jesse is awesome. I will watch this show once a year and I never get bored. Forget about the hyped shows you'll only watch once. This is the one and only you should watch right now If you haven't already. The only show that got me this excited in the last decade was Dark.Just look at the rating for breaking bad and you'll know what's up. Not many shows can hold up this rating for so long.

I give it a concrete 7. It is well worth watching. It absolutely IS a good series. Just allow for a steady stream of implausible moments throughout the series where various story points just aren't remotely believable.\nEnjoy the good (there is plenty), and look over the ludicrous (there is plenty). Enjoy the show.

This beautiful piece of art is incredibly well written and directed, furthermore the actors are doing a tremendous job! I've read a few remarks about the pace of the show, saying it is too slow. I completely disagree, there are so many aspects which get their place in the series, every single one in its own way and it would be horrible if we'd see a too fast paced show containing ridiculous cliffhangers like we see them on the major networks. Because this way you can entirely fall in love with the show, the characters and every tiny detail of the story and the best part of it, it is unbelievably addictive and makes you starve for more week after week! 10/10 Kudos to Mr. Gilligan, kudos to Mr. Cranston and kudos to everyone else who's making a contribution to this show!

The characters are unique and incredibly well developed, with the show not being afraid of testing them psychologically in a way that not many animes are willing to. The fights are intense both physically and psychologically and as the Anime progresses they tend to become more violent and over the edge.The soundtrack is beautiful. From the intense/epic classic orchestras to the guitar riffs, everything seems to fall into place. Even the show's "intros" and "outros" are very consistent and worth listening to.All in all, this is the kind of Anime that a true fan of this Japanese art will not want to miss.

In HD-widescreen, you can really feel the action and connect to the story and the characters.I am following the new release weekly, and every new episode I am astonished by the high quality of the sound, picture and story which are exactly how they should be.Hunter X Hunter story is rich, interesting and authentic, and the writers of this new series did a great job transferring and transmitting it.Another great feature in the new series is the background adjustment to our time - Phones, computers and more electronic devices that were rare and undeveloped in the Manga can now be found and used anywhere, without damaging the story. I believe it even adds to the experience.This is a must-see show, to any fan of this genre (Especially to whom had seen and/or read Hunter X Hunter), though I would really recommend this series to anyone.

stretched for 5 episodes. the story plot is so twisted but yet there are no flaws or loop holes. the explanations make sense and are fun to listen to. there is a balance between the intense gory moments and the light hearted jokish moments. the characters are liakable, even the villains. its just the perfect anime. and don't listen to those people who say that this version is rubbish compared to the 1999 version. its ten times better. the show might start of a little childish but its picks up the pace in no time. i recommend this to anyone i meet...literally. its just that damn good

Well, I noticed some anime seemed focused on adults (not the sex stuff, but violence and intelligent plots and stuff), so I tried own -- Sword Art Online. It really opened my eyes to these hidden treasures -- the stories blend fantasy elements with action and interesting characters. Really the main thing I noticed was being surprised by plot twists. Whereas an American TV series or movie you can pretty much guess where it's going to go, this took turns and twists that really impressed me with the intelligence of the show. I mean, Lost took a lot of twists, but they were sort of random/contrived, and my final analysis was the writers were just making it up as they went along to avoid answering any hard questions, very stupid and contrived. Sword Art avoided that.Anyway, after finishing that anime, I tried several more, and while some were good and still better than traditional American shows, none had the intelligent plotting of Sword Art Online -- till I found Hunter X Hunter, which just totally kicked it up a notch in both fantasy elements, interesting characters, intelligent plot twists you won't see coming, and the like. With some bad guys being sort of serial murderer/pedophiles, it's not for kids, but well done...even those pervy bad guys sometimes redeem themselves, at least for a short time.How the main characters got more powerful as the series progressed, to be able to best stronger and stronger foes (usually) was well thought out, too, and not overly simplistic. The only downside was that by the fifth (?) story arc involving mutant ant people, I felt it had gotten a bit formulaic and I was not buying into how the world was responding to this threat, and felt the series might have jumped the shark, so to speak. However, I stuck it out and halfway through the arc I really started to enjoy it and the plot kept taking interesting twists. I'm not ashamed to say that I cried at least once because there were such bittersweet moments created.I don't think I ever enjoyed a movie or TV series more than Hunter X Hunter, and with over 150 episodes, that's a LOT of great TV.

I don't want to say anything to spoil it, and I'm sure that countless others have already provided more in-depth reasons why you should watch it, but still, watch it.I will warn you though, while the beginning of the show makes it seem like its going to be somewhat kid-friendly, trust me when I say that this is not the case.

, if you did not watch it yet , go DAMN WATCH IT RIGHT NOW !!! , just to sum up everything , Hunter X Hunter 2011 = Epic and yet i can't believe that this anime is so underrated and only some people are watching it, people are watching one piece and other popular animes and not watching Hunter X Hunter 2011 HUH, thats really sad =(P.S: when i watched this anime in the beginning i thought it is childish but DAMN just give it your shot !

An epic out of this world adventure between three friends whose friendship never dies. I have never had more fun, never laughed more, and never felt more emotion than after watching Hunter x Hunter. Every anime series I have ever seen pales in comparison. Hunter x Hunter is better than Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, better than Death Note, better than Naruto, better than One Piece, better than Steins;Gate, better than Attack on Titan, better than Code Geass. My eyes have been opened after watching this series: Hunter x Hunter cannot be rivalled. If Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is a 10, Hunter x Hunter is a 15, no joke. Hunter x Hunter (2011) has better script, better characters, better acting, better scenery, better pacing, and better story than every anime I have listed above. It's a journey; it's an epic adventure; it's a coming of age; it's out of this world. It's a shame a lot of people don't know about it just because it doesn't have an English dub; it's a shame it only has a few thousand votes on IMDb. If only everyone knew what they were missing. I wish that I had seen the original series growing up; how different might my childhood have been; I grew up with Dragon Ball Z, Pokemon, and similar shows. My first time watching near the end of 2014, and Hunter x Hunter is now my favourite anime of all time, no question about it. The main characters of Hunter x Hunter (2011) will stick with me for the rest of my life. I have never laughed more than with Leorio. I have never cried more than with Killua and Gon who show the real value of friendship. The lessons I have learned from this show about friendship, love, and family have impacted me greatly.Thank you Hunter x Hunter. After binge watching every episode within one week because I couldn't stop myself at the bliss, I have been reborn. Best Anime of all time, without a doubt. I have nothing more to say, except that you MUST watch this anime before you die. YOU MUST. YOU MUST. YOU MUST.

It's also a series that make you laugh really easily with all kinds of spontaneous and stupid humor that i love.The old one was as great, the only differences are that in this one Killua looks even younger and the last one ended at one moment where something happened that could have ended the series but in this one they continue from that moment.Watch this series, I beg you, and you won't ever regret it!

It draws real life parallels to Nuclear weapons, human greed, global warming and many others. But the thing is the audience watch a series is to get entertained. If the series is thought provoking and talks about real life issues in addition to be entertaining, it does make them memorable. But such things shouldn't come at the cost of entertainment and storytelling. This is the exact problem, the chimera ant arc is suffering from. It talks big whilst being utterly boring. Since the chimera ant arc makes up for almost half of the anime series, it becomes a con for the series too.My other problems with the arc are1. Total deviation from established motives and followups to the goals of the protagonists.2. The creator shows a big middle finger if you cared about protagonists. He leaves out 2 protagonists like they don't exist and makes other two protagonists as side characters in their own series.3. Too much focus on secondary and rudimentary characters.4. The ants' designs are ridiculous and silly. I mean these supposedly ants are humanoid animals born with helmet, tees, ear piercings and what not.5. The complete devolution of a protagonist due to the loss of a character whom he had known for like few weeks is unbelievable.6. I have few words for the narrator, " Jeez, just calm down".This arc killed this series for me when I was binge watching the series up until this arc. The phantom troupe arc was the highest point of the series imo from which it never truly recovers. Hey, atleast the chairman election arc ends the series in a decent note.

really wanted to give this show a try, I loved the first 40 episodes but then it went very downhill and ended in the toilet, the main characters didn't change, some characters are based on currently existing better characters and the chimera ant arc was very cliché, too long and full of tropes.The innocent one who changed the villain, the protagonist who unleashed the beast, even the humans are the real monsters trope existed.It made me really sad I liked the idea of Nen and there were some characters I really liked but I just couldn't find it that amazing like it was portrayed.

Without going into spoilers I can't say much, but this show gets pretty deep and has amazing fight scenes. There's many interesting characters to keep the plot moving.
## 14 7.6?Why so underrated?This rating doesn't do justice to this show,it needs more recognition. Lets set it right. I have seen both versions of Hunter x Hunter and I liked the 1999 version better so there will be inevitably some slight comparisons in this review to the 2011 one.Story: Togashi Yoshihiro is a very talented mangaka who managed to create a world of great imagination where he can take you from dark realistic settings to a virtual reality cheerful world.The story progresses in arc format with each arc being connected nicely together, of course there is the main story where the protagonist a small boy named Gon embarks on a journey to search for his father a "Hunter" where lots of difficult challenges and adventures awaits him.Apart for the first few episodes the pace was really good and I never got bored but it still was 10 times better then the old version where the beginning was slow and kind of awful.In the first arc you get to know the world of HxH and it's protagonists, it may take for a while to draw you in so stick with it because it will get epic.What sets it apart of any other anime at least of this genre if not all anime it's the disruption of a linear plot progress.Plot twists in some episodes are just insane.At some points I literally was in shock and kept thinking about what happened for many days or weeks after the episode. You will never expect for some things to happen.I found the complexity and simplicity of the story in perfect equivalence, it's simple in it's general view but individual elements can be quite complex(eg. a system of a country, fighting system, analytical thinking of an antagonist etc). In short it was an intelligent story with perfect mix of mystery,tension,comedy and action. Don't make the mistake I did when I labeled it as childish when i had seen only 10 episodes, give it a try and you will discover a mature and deep story with the psychological factor being present all over the place. Story:9/10 (I would rate it a 10 but I can't because of the weak beginning). Art: Animation is amazing in this series, the best of the best.And as it progresses it gets even better especially in the fight scenes where the effects are awesome and enhance the experience.The bright colors is one of the major things that made me personally like 1999 version better, because dark colors used in the old one created a dark atmosphere which suited better for this anime(it felt more epic and created more tension). That doesn't mean I hate the new version though.The designs of each character are unique and suits their personalities quite well which as an effect makes them memorable (one antagonist became one of my favorite antagonist ever!!!). Art:10/10Sound: There was only one thing I hated about the sound and that was the opening song(I always skipped it), the end song though was quite enjoyable. As for the soundtracks I can say they were epic especially in moments of tension or mystery. I didn't quite like the happy go lucky background soundtrack but that was only at the beginning, I actually appreciated it more cause it made the moments of tension feel 10 times more epic!!! Voice actors are all good except for the one of Kurapica who's voice I didn't like but I may be influenced by the old version. The voices for the 2 main protagonists are especially well picked up.Although I prefer the 99 version sound and voices better I will stay objective and rate the sound a 9. Sound:9/10 Characters:Most of my favorite characters are from this show and as you can guess characters in this show are amazing, there is no one who is underdeveloped or one dimensional. Lots of hours have been spent in developing each of them making them unique and memorable in their own skin, some will be mysterious and threatening like no other you've seen,some others intelligent and patient another might be compassionate and vulnerable.What is truly amazing though as I mentioned before is the presence of the psychological factor. Which means that no one will act always the same in different situations just to follow their stereotype as the situation changes.What I mean is that your expectations for some characters being one thing will be diminished into being the complete opposite. That's why the plot twists are amazing and logically and emotionally feel correct. Characters:10/10Overall:Hunter x Hunter 2011 is the best anime than any other at this genre I've seen.It blends together and balances exceptionally well themes like drama, mystery, comedy and action.I enjoyed this series so much that I am actually thinking about rewatching the old version first and at some point the 2011 again. I hope you will give it a try because I honestly believe you will enjoy it very much.I recommend this series to everyone and it doesn't matter what genres you like more, just trust me and give this series a go but stick with it cause it's kinda slow at the beginning. Overall:10/10*This is my first review so forgive me for any mistakes*

The remake was so Loyal to the original anime But some little Scene were Cut to save some time for the new Episode that will added after it Complete the Original anime episode . The New Show was so Refresh When I watched the old one I was so angry Because of the Clarity wasn't cool But Now it Gives you a Feeling that it's Not the Remake its so much Better in the Story and in the Graphic Quality in the End I Enjoyed it as the same I enjoyed the old one and Now with the new Episode that Came out I can Say I enjoyed it more so I Give my thanks to the Creator Of this Great Show Good Job.

Everything in the show is perfect, the fight scenes are amazing and epic. I hope there will be more anime that is good as Hunter x hunter and fun to watch like this. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

The fights were very great, the anime characters were excellent, especially Chrollo Lucilfer and Netero. They were the best two characters in the anime. I also liked that Gon does not win in most battles I hope the anime will continue, but the writer does not want to write

One of the best anime's I've ever seen. I loved all the characters and the story was very enticing, it made me want to keep watching to see what would happen next. My favorite characters were Gon, Killua, hisoka and the insect king. The story with the insect king was so sad, it made me want to cry towards the end of the story. This is one of those shows you have to watch!I said what I said. Wish there were more episodes. Loved every second of it.I recommend everyone to watch!!!!!!!!!True 'MASTERPRICE'

Personally, its no 1 on my list. No matter how many animes I watch, nothing compares to HunterXHunter. The characters have been so beautifully written and mindfully built by Yoshihiro Togashi (Bless this man) that you can't help but trip and fall painfully in love with them.The main protagonists (Gon,Killua,Leorio and Kurapika) all have their own unique backgrounds and quirky personalities which is super fun to watch in itself but when you put them all in the same equation, their chemistry is just overwhelmingly adorable that it makes you wanna cry happy tears.Let's talk action! Being a shounen anime HunterXHunter has its own proud share of epic battles and power displays, it seriously gives you goosebumps.What about bad guys,you ask?I would like to say special attention has been given by Togashi to put some life and spice into the antagonists/anti-heros in the series. They aren't just powerful and mean,but have extremely intriguing personalities. They body slam you into loving them as well.All in all, HunterXHunter is a well balanced anime. There is friendship,fluff,fights and fan service. What else can a weeb ask for. .Highly recommended!!

Very interesting characters, good story arcs, and the usual dependable themes. Beware if you are going to become an hunter x hunter fan craze cat you need to stay loyal to the series, because it is well known for being on hiatus. Interestingly for a anime it doesn't necessarily work on the lines of "I have more raw power than you therefore I win". In hunter x hunter it is more the case of how the powers are used, you can be weaker than your opponent yet you might win because of a special skill you have for example. The battle system in hunter x hunter is the most interesting I have encountered.

At its worst, it's patronizing and self-referential in a way that's been the catalyst to create some of the egotistical fanbases that it now has.However, for all that's been said about this show (the good and the bad), that's precisely what has driven its ethos for 7 seasons (and more) - "we can make fun of whatever we want to and do whatever we want to because what you love doesn't actually matter. You and I are both going to die one day."I love this show for many reasons. Top of the list being - what they make fun of, I also understand and love as well. From Ice T, to Birdperson, to the council of the Rick's, and the commercial for Two Brothers, this show has no problem letting its imagination drive the engine in fresh, new ways while being wholly unoriginal most of the time (and better for it).

It is easily the best animation show I have seen in a while on any network. The second the show starts you can tell that the characters fit perfectly with each other, and involved with the craziness that happens in the universe with Rick and Morty, they are immediately hilarious and extremely creative at the same time. A couple episodes in and I could tell that this was a unique show, and that people need to be watching it because it has huge potential. And with Dan Harmon writing and directing at the helm of it all, the magic that this show brings is a rare gem in television that people need to watch.. So yeah I highly suggest this show to anyone who wants a true genuine laugh at least once a week.

It is *dark*, but there are certainly moments that approach the limits of any sort of television style format.The ending of "Rick Potion #9" is just amazing. Likewise, the end of "M. Night Shaym Aliens".The strength of the show is just how amoral Rick may be; but there is a strong attachment to the "many universes" hypothesis within the show. Philosophers have long debated the moral implications of "many universes" ( while realizing it's a bit sophomoric and nerdy ) ; "Rick and Morty" picks at this as its stock in trade. Morty is our avatar, and works in that capacity extremely well.The essential dyad at the center - the title characters - interact little with the more peripheral characters, who have mainly been used in B plots. This shifts of course, and with these sorts of shows they will always mix this for plot gain. There's a rich enough set of characters to provide ample space. The interaction between Rick and Morty hoists a bit from classic propaganda tropes without actually being propagandist; a heck of a trick. It must be hard to calibrate this.The entire show is just chock full of nuggets and neither preaches nor deigns to condescend to the audience. Pacing is always even and feels right. The writers know where to push and where not to.We will see how long this can be maintained. The writers show a gift for twisting & adding-to old plots into new shows. Hopefully that's a stable arrangement.As an "agent of Chaos", Rick should serve us for many years. There are actual ideas underneath all the humor, and here's to them. This might well be the best thing on television right now.

It's hilarious and original! My favorite animated series are Family Guy, Archer, Bojack Horsemen, shows like that and this is right there with them. It's definitely weird but in a good way, a way that will keep you laughing at every episode. You really become invested in it's world and characters like it's a thrilling drama, not an adult animated comedy. Each episode is funny, smart and weird. It's exactly what a science fiction comedy should be. Don't be like me and keep putting off...watch it, it really is as good as everyone says it is!

The episodes so far have always seemed fresh and the writing is hilarious and creative. But then there's no surprise really since its co-creator created Community.The hilarious mixture of wittiness, slapstick and action all add to making this show one of the best cartoons I have ever seen.From what I've seen so far, the show easily parodies different movies and topics, also slyly sneaking in references (sometimes not slyly).The art also is simple, but very appealing. Because the show is animated, Dan Harmon, Justin Roiland and the writers have been able to break free from the chains of live action, making the show more out of this world.I highly recommend this show to anyone, especially fans of the Regular Show, Adventure Time and Community.

It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it.

I was really looking forward to Rick and Morty based on the hilarious teaser and the fact that this is a hand drawn show like older, more classic cartoons. My concern was that it would end up with a weak, poorly written script. That is not the case whatsoever. This show is incredibly original with its writing, characters, style and imagination. Every episode AND joke is completely different from the last, which keeps this show fresh and exciting to watch. While I think Rick (the grandpa) is the funniest, No character is bad. Morty, his dog Snuffles, and even Morty's math teacher all pack in great jokes. The directing is great and the art style and the way it is drawn is really really good. The only problem I have with the show, is that I don't really think they know how to end each episode (so far at least). But, this is truly a breath of fresh air when it comes to comedy, and I think adultswim has a really good show on their hands... 9/10

The concept instinctively didn't make sense to me, at first. A grandpa and his grandson. What I loved from the start was the adventurous alternate universes, and the potential in my imagination. This show could go anywhere. What really stuck was a couple of alternate universes that really touched my heart. I didn't expect that. And I would have settled for less. The jokes by themselves are hilarious, already. All main characters have proper personalities, unseen to date. The show didn't go for 'smooth.' Maybe, you have to go for something else to achieve 'smooth.' You can't aim for smooth, but that's the only thing, I can think of, that falls short of a 10. A "Captain-America-smooth." Maybe the last thing that's missing is a shield ? Naw. But all those adventures need to start standing for something. Even if Grandpa Rick is just chasing that kind of over-arching ... thing.

I 100% agree with the reviews that say seasons 1-3 are amazing and anything after that is a tough watch.Don't get me wrong, there are some great episodes sprinkled into seasons 4-5, but they are too few and far between to make the show really worth sticking with.Season 6 was tough. Season 7 was nearly impossible to finish and I don't feel confident about the series moving forward.I wouldn't recommend keeping a subscription to pay for this show. Wait until all eps are free at this point, imo.The show lost its heart and soul and in the words of Rick himself, "It's a joyless cash grab."RIP Rick and Morty 😢.

They feel so unnatural, forced. It's like the writers changed completely, not the voice actor. If I didn't know Roiland was swapped for somebody else I woudn't have noticed by just voices alone. But voices aside, the writing is irredeemable. A show that had such great episodes in the earlier seasons that it had infinite rewatchability, has come to this.Other episodes of the season were bad as well, with varying degrees. But the last one (s07e04) had no funny moment. At all. Simply no witty dialogue. No cool story. Instead of absurd scenes, where the whole setting is funny to begin with, it's just shock value.In the earlier seasons it was maybe 1 (one) bad episode per season. Right now we are looking at 1 (one) GOOD episode per season, optimistically. It is well and truly over.Despite a few cringe episodes in the earlier seasons, that I wrote off as nonexistant in my headcanon , this was at one point my favourite TV show. Now turned mediocre. At this point I'd rather just watch Family Guy and South Park. Despite both shows being past their prime, at least there is some "in your face" humor to be found there. All that's left in Rick and Morty is a lame, unfunny regurgitation of the things we've seen or a subpar social commentary."Morty, I discovered suicide. It's when you die by killing yourself, Morty. And we're gonna make it an episode. Season 9 more seasons of Rick and Morty for 97 more years"\n10 for the first few season and 1 for the latest instalments, with average rounded down to 5 . Adios.

Judging from the sneak peaks and previews, I assumed this was going to be just another family guy/ Brikleberry lazily animated show with some cheap and low standards. Well gee wizz, I was very very wrong! Rick and Morty might seem like some stupid knock off of Back to the Future or some money laundering scheme as part of late night cable TV, but its not. Behind all the jokes, each episode surprisingly has a strong message and whether you can relate to it or not, you won't really feel like the end of each episode was a bummer.The weakest aspect is the animation. Its not pretty and seems out dated. Despite this, its hard to say that this pulls the show down. No, not even one bit. The absolutely clever writing and well designed character personalities are basically what this show floats upon. Unlike many other cartoons that have a sub plot in every episode, the ones in this show are actually relevant and memorable. They aren't just there as fillers and they are nearly as important as the main story. In fact, in most episodes its hard to tell which one is the sub plot and which one is the main plot.What I'm trying to say is that this show is near perfect. What are you still doing watching new Simpsons and Family guy, go watch this show if you haven't already. Its a great example of how TV hasn't turned to total crap.

Reminds me of the chemistry of Doc and Marty Mcfly from the Back to the Future series with a rated R twist. Slowly but surely the are tweaking character development. Getting better every new episode!!! I like the way Rick is always drinking and burping and slurring his speech. This show is getting a lot of acclaim with so few episodes and it deserves every bit. Honestly this is the best cartoons aimed at young adults and teens that I've seen in a years. I always get excited when I see a new episode trailer!!! Can't wait to see what direction they take this to in the future. They have set it up for literally limitless possibilities.

I have the same feeling I had when I watched Family Guy for the first time, in which I felt like every single character was interesting and was contributing for the series in their own ways. In this show, things that will make you laugh are dark and awkward at times which succeed every time. I haven't found a single bad moment so far in the first three episodes and can't wait to watch the whole thing The first episode was awesome and got me straight to the next. The dog world domination episode is going to be a classic, go watch it. People will remember that episode.

The humor is crazy and is hurled at the audience with breathless speed. Every joke doesn't hit, but there are so many of them that it hardly matters, and when they do hit, they hit hard.That makes it a good show, but what makes it a truly great series is the intelligence of the crazy sci-fi ideas that fuel the stories. Yes, a miniverse inside a miniverse inside a miniverse is ridiculous, but it's also wonderfully ingenious, especially as you see both the variety and consistency of these worlds. A being that insinuates itself into everyone's memories was beautifully done. An episode in which your mind can create your concept of your partner was smart from the beginning, but then kept expanding on the idea.Every idea is nonsensical, but every idea is ingenious and fully explored. This is not just good comedy, it's good sci-fi.I wish this show had lasted as long as the Simpsons (i.e. forever) but what there is is fantastic.

Even though there is a story to follow in the lore throughout the episodes and seasons, it isn't 100% necessary to watch them in order and to know what is going on. This is because each of the episodes follow a short story/adventure that mainly follows Rick and Morty however sometimes there will be a combination of characters in the adventure.I enjoy thé creativity of the show, as the premise of the show follows Rick, a Scientific genius who developed portal travel and other interesting Si-Fi gadgets, and because of this, anything can happen and the stories can run wild. I have watched this a few times however I find that I always like the very different adventures from episode to episode.One thing that is seen underlying in the show which I think is done very well is the character development and their interaction with one another. From Beth and Jerry's failing marriage to Ricks sense of depression, pushing people away and loneliness. This sort of character lore provides something a bit extra for the viewer and sometimes can allow some relation between the characters and the viewer.
## 18 Scratch that. This may be the best Cartoon Network show period! Yeah, you don't normally group Adult Swim shows with other ones, but as someone who watches both, this is freaking awesome! The funniest thing is how I was introduced to this series. I was actually recommended by a friend at work to see it. I looked here on the IMDb and found out it had the highest rating of any animated show (not including anime) that I'd ever seen! And you know what? I think it completely deserves it.Apart from having good animation, the characters and stories in this show are just so freaking fun. Every single character is dysfunctional in some way, but never to the point where they're unlikeable. Rick of course steals the show. I believe it when I hear that Rick represents a cynical part of our personalities and Morty is the idealistic one. The fact that both of these characters are voiced by Justin Roiland makes it all the more obvious. I keep expecting Morty to say "Unacceptable!" at any time. I kept wondering who this guy was and why I kept hearing him in every cartoon I was watching.I have yet to find a single episode of this show I didn't like. Then again, the show hasn't gone on that long and I haven't seen all the episodes. I think my favorite is probably "Lawnmower Dogs". The two plots are so good and hilarious. Anything with Scary Terry is amusing. What sets this apart from lesser shows like "Family Guy" is that this show does work so much harder to make you laugh and doesn't try to just gross you out. It really does focus on character development and takes time to make jokes relevant to the story. It's still not quite as good as "South Park" but it's fairly close in terms of adult cartoons. I think my former favorite Adult Swim show was "Robot Chicken" or perhaps "The Venture Bros.".There's quite a lot of variety in Rick and Morty's adventures. There's quite a bit of creativity. There even are some truly heartwarming moments. I can always count on this to make me laugh or entertain me in any way. This just succeeds where so many adult cartoons have failed as they try to hard to be obscene or just aren't funny. The plot? Well, not really much except Rick travels through space and other dimensions with his grandson, Morty. The vocal range is great and it's nice and colorful.Watch this show and laugh like mad. Perfect ****!

Each episode is a strange and interesting adventure\nBut honestly, if you spend at least twenty minutes of your time watching this animation every day, of course! If you look at it as temporary entertainment, you'll definitely be satisfied, but if you want to watch it as an animation with a fixed and determined theme, I don't think you'll be satisfied.But it actually makes me happy to know that there are other parts of it that I haven't seen yet!This encourages me a lot to support\nAnd also to say that my favorite character is Rick!

At first it makes you take a second to get used and into it. But it's as intelligent and hilarious a show as I haven't seen one since a long time! That's what I and hopeful many other viewers are going to realize after a couple of minutes. It'S one of those shows that wouldn't happen to be without Adult Swim. Not exactly a family show. Anyways - this show is brilliant. The humor is not as cheap as in most of the successful cartoons and the show is not as comfortable to watch, but that's one thing that makes it so hilarious. It's really dark sometimes, and the viewer with a good sense of humor will appreciate that. The only thing that might make the show a bit better is that the creators could make the characters a bit better known and thus more likable to the viewer. Like this a plot as in episode 6 (SE1) would work even better. Well, the characters maybe a bit flat still, but the plots and happenings are making all this acceptable. Amazingly funny and thoughtful story line for a 20min cartoon show. The sad part is, that it might not really be for the rank and file and as a result might not last for too long or even be recognized by too many people. I really hope this goes on for a while, though! I love this show - it's great. Keep up the good workPS.: I hope they take one or two scientists on board to help them with Grandpa Rick to keep him on track regarding scientific accuracy. But that'S just a personnel tic of mine...

These new writers are very formulaic. They think "this is what a Rick and Morty show must have in it". Originality is gone. Also the new writers are trying to make this into a Simpsons/Family Guy cartoon with all the family.First three seasons are wonderful and you can watch them over and over. Season 4 and 5, are tolerable enough to watch once.I would strongly suggest they get back the old writers. Also cut back on having the family in the show. It's making the show Simpsons with crude jokes.

Just plain fantastic! Just what we've been waiting for! At a loss for words!! Thank You God! It's about time that writers have opened up to ideas from a new realm! This is it! No hold bars, out of this world, other dimensions, straight in your face! Brilliant! I can't wait to see more! I have to see more! There better be more; it would be pretty ugly, otherwise! Hawt-dam! Yee-Freaking-Haa! Sit down, strap in, hold on and be amazed! Super clever, great story lines, great visuals, smooth, exciting, thought provoking works of art; absolute masterpieces! I applaud the writers and commend them for their brilliance and am so excited this is happening! Rick and Morty FOREVER!!!

Like other comparable shows like Family Guy or South Park, this is absolute brilliant animation comedy that is meant to not only beg your attention by being so fast-talking, but also because it has a deeper underlying message that will make sense in whatever it means to you. Brilliant.Keep it comin'.

Too much of the Adult Swim programming is mean-spirited and ugly, but "Rick & Morty" balances its cynicism with moments of genuine familial and societal warmth. The characters are well-developed and evolve over the course of the season, and the voice talent is gifted -- Chris Parnell is the secret weapon as Morty's not-too-bright dad. The Pilot is the only episode I was Luke-warm on, because it's the only one where the nastiness overwhelms everything else, but it fits well into the course of the entire season because it gives the bitter alcoholic grandfather Rick something to grow away from, and the first year gets better and better as it rolls along.There isn't a lot of TV I can watch with my son, but this is just about the best of it. Can't wait for season 2, and I hope there will be more than 11 episodes.

And nothing will ever be the same.When I finished Breaking Bad back in 2019 prior to ever watching anime, if someone told me an anime would be on the same playing field as Breaking Bad and even exceed it at times, I would've told them they were crazy. But in reality, I was the crazy one. This story took me places mentally and emotionally I didn't think I could go.In this dark and cruel world created by Hajime Isayama, while some things are objectively wrong, there's never a moment where you can definitively say that someone's the good guy or bad guy. Once you see the full picture of the show, it's indescribable to explain the show in the manner of good and bad considering how much everyone's in this dark abyss of a gray area that has no objective answer to whom is in the right or wrong. And that's the beauty of AOT.Attack On Titan is not meant to be joyous. It's a tragedy. It's an unfair world where everyone at some point is given a dirty hand whether they deserve it or not, and the characters have to try and live with that reality and keep moving forward. Now that doesn't mean that there aren't moments where you as a viewer can feel joyous for your perspective favorite character/side because there likely will be, but when you're no longer told the story through this small microscope, you won't be able to see the show the same.And that's where the absurd genius of the creator Hajime Isayama comes into play. As much as I love the Vince Gilligan's of the world, David Chase, Peter Gould, Jesse Armstrong, David Simon and honestly any writer of any piece of fiction... no one comes close to the creativity that this man has. Isayama is able to create this large world in these small walls surrounded by humanoid creatures that live to destroy and ruin the human race. But as you continue to watch the show, it's like you're peeling an endless onion that doesn't stop, and constantly makes your eyes water and tear up due to the brutality and the absurdity that this universe subjects you to. It will boggle your mind then tear you to shreds in ways that I've never seen before.The plot twists are second to none. The heartbreak will shatter you to pieces. The betrayals will leave you speechless. The world building will make everything before seem small. And the clashes of different ideals will leave you wondering how you could even pick a side. I could go on all day but to put it simply, the unique story in itself is what brings this all together. And that's not even mentioning things like the voice acting, music, animation, esc. Which are all top tier.This isn't an anime. This isn't a TV show. This is a fictional masterpiece. And I'm honored and blessed to say that I got to live to see the day where I'd witness the end of it. Thank you, Hajime Isayama. And see you later, AOT.

and detail that went into this. From the initial scene that shows you the main and unique weapons to some of the frames that could literally be used as your desktop background or be hanged in your room as paintings. From episode to episode you'll think that you won't be surprised anymore and you'll be wrong again and again, every time I thought an episode or season couldn't be better I was proven wrong. You will get goos bumps from dialog alone and you will lose your mind in the epic fight scenes The characters and their development, the story covered in mystery that unveils beautifully, a dialog carefully written that shows the characters personalities and wisdom., sound design, music, illumination... you'll feel like you are there. The voicing of the characters is excellent... there is nothing below excellent in this. An absolute masterpiece and a bar of quality for any audio visual product to come. Be prepared to care only about Attack on Titan and nothing else, because nothing else will make you feel this way.

watching this show, I couldn't imagine why it is rated so high. After I finished the first season, I understood. And now, having watched the third season I don't understand, why it isn't rated even higher!Truly a masterpiece, and deserves to be mentioned on the same page as other fantasy war epics like Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones. (I dare to say this is even better than those two.) There are countless twist and turns, shocking revelations and heartbreaking moments troughout the series, spiced with great voice acting, beautiful visuals and on top of all: a more than perfect, stunning soundtrack, thanks to Hiroyuki Sawano.The story is brilliantly written, and does not slow down, not even for a bit. It keeps growing bigger and bigger, while you will find yourself tied to your chair, as you can't watch only one or two episodes. Behind the plot and the action, there is also deeper meaning about war, humanity and questions about moral dilemmas.Toughtprovoking, exciting and most of all a masterpiece of our time!

getting into arguments with my friends and my son that those were the golden anime era and now I have to admit. This is if not the best story telling I witness in all my years. This show raise the bars with each episode, with unpredictable twist and turns you won't see coming. After completing season 4 mid season finally I must say I'm happy to be alive witnessing a master peace in the making. Can't wait for the finally!

I have been watching multiple great TV shows in the past 10 years: Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Lost, Westworld, The Boys, Dark, House of Cards, Sherlock etc. - just to name a few. Attack on Titan caught my attention one day after I checked the top 250 TV shows on IMDB and saw multiple 10/10 featured reviews from other people, especially considering that it's an anime that is ranked very high on the list.Hence, I came to AoT with high expectation and after watching it, I'm surprised that it only gets a 9/10. This show is definitely not inferior to Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad, though I understand that being an animated, foreign show means that it has to try much harder to prove its worth.I find AoT to be almost perfect, and I don't think it's realistic to expect any shows to be perfect. After all, these pieces of arts are all created by human being and we are imperfect! What other reviewers said about AoT is absolutely true: AoT has incredible storytelling, world building, plot twist, foreshadowing, character development and excellent soundtracks. On top of that, I trust the hype also comes from the fact that this show builds such a strongly immersive world for viewers where one can feel being part of its world and understanding the characters' motives and actions. This exerts a strong impact on our feelings and the theme itself is so thought-provoking, which is not something a lot of shows could do. And trust me, I believe I watched enough good series and movies so as not to be easily impressed. On a side note, I don't find the lowest ratings for AoT justified, but rather superficial. Among the lowest reviews I've seen so far on IMDB, none has truly given a critical analysis of why the show is objectively bad - it's either coming from pure haters, those who are too impatient to watch the story in full or those who just don't want to understand the series because of existing bias. Also, any comments saying that AoT is predictable and cliché is the same as saying GoT is predictable too 😊.The show keeps getting better and better after each season with lots of jaw-dropping twists. As such, I do respect its consistently high quality after 10 years since its first episode and after seeing multiple great TV series starting off well and had degrading quality after a few seasons. There is only 1 episode left and the show so far has only raised the bar after each episode. I know about the ending through the manga and I find it absolutely satisfying. It's considered to be a controversial ending where the fandom is splitted. But I think that's the beauty of this series - it's more real than a live-action show and it correctly depicts the actual world. There is no boundary of good or bad, right or wrong - it's all about perspective.All in all, a phenomenal journey that I'm utterly grateful to embark on. An absolute 10/10 for this masterpiece - a pity that 10 is all there is to rate.

I haven't even read the manga, which I'll do it btw. But I can assure you that attack on titan will keep you interested from the very beginning thanks to a gripping and original plot. There isn't a single boring episode, it's always suspance and action. It may seem a superficial fantasy anime but it actually deals with important topics, such as freedom. Furthermore, the soundtracks are so good that you will start feeling patriotism for an imaginary country.
## 7  Review By Kamal KStory 10/10It continunes few days after where we left off last season and it focuses more on political drama and dilemmas inside the walls. This season gets straight to the point and introduces new villain named Kenny that turns out to be somehow related to Levi. There are many parties trying to get Eren and Historia. For what reason? It is yet to be reveald. Mystery we all feel in love with is still there and there are even more questions, but don't let that distract you from the fact that this season ,even tho is only few episodes in, already has some major reveals in it. Pacing is amazing and i wasn't bored for a moment while watching. Things are only getting more interesting when Erwin reveals how he's planning to ovethrow the governmant without using the force. This season has a very refreshing and different plot compared to previous ones as we can see from the lack of titans and focuse on the issues inside the walls rather than beyond. However it's still as, if not more interesting than before. There is world buidling,mystery,back stabbing and some major questions answered which there is hopfully more to come.Animation 10/10As we can see characters in this season look a little bit different or older which some might not like but i do personally. It's a fresh change. They look closer to their manga designes. Some might notice that they removed those thick black lines around characters faces which made AOT art stand out even more. Don't get me wrong, it still does but that was something that was missing which kept me from giving it 10/10.\nAnimation is brilliant for this season (it's Attack on Titan after all :D) and like every season it only got better. . Perfect combination between 3D background and 2D animation along with masterfull camera movement made this scene look like a movie. There is even one frame where levi is facing the wall and you can see his reflection in the window. Just goes to show how much detail and time was put in to this scene. After i done some research i found out that it took the animator of this scene 1 whole month to complete it. Just that one scene alone. All props to Arifumi Imai. Great job. Hopfully it keeps this quality because this season is said to be 24 episodes long.Sound 10/10I mean, is there anything to say? AoT is notorious for it's amazing OST and sound quality. Voice actors are great as always and the sound that stand out to me the most was the sound of falling shell from kenny on the roof in ep.1. It was just so satisfying :D. And again mad props to Hiroyuki Sawano (the composer) for the epic and emotional music.Characters 10/10What i like about AoT characters is the fact that they interact so naturally and nothing from their conversation seems forced which is immediately showcased in the very first scene in ep. 1. That cabin scene where jean and eren argue,sasha tries to steal bread, mikasa still does work even tho she's injured and armin cares for her deeply. And of course Levi the clean freak comes in at the end :p They are such fun and lively characters.\nThis season already had some major development for our cast. We got to see Erwin's and Hisotira's backstories which also delved deeper in their characters motives. Both backstories were heartbreaking and made me care a lot more for them. Hisotira is slowly taking of her "Christa Lenz" facade (is that how you say it? lol) and Erwin is proving again and again why everyone loves him and would follow him to death. His childhood story is very similar to how our society and governmant wokrs today which is very scary. And we all need to remember that isayama is criticizing this type of government and society with these topics. Instead of just walking of Erwin comes back to Dimo Rivees's wife and comforts her saying he'll avange him. Erwin is charismatic,great leader, intellignet and someone that you just want to follow. Since the young age he was corious and as he call himself a "gambler". He is someone that would give everything for the humanity. Or is he? I think there is a lot more to his character. Hange got some development too. Eren is maturing and seems a lot more chill this season but unfortunately he is kiddnaped again :( Poor guy he just can't catch a break. In ep.1 he helps historia to overcome here pain and shows again just how honest he is by telling her "I like you more this way, just a stupidly normal honest girl". Also hugeee development for armin. To think that he would be capable of killing a human.. this will deffinitely have a huge impact on his character in the future. The way he selfreflects and his philosohpical speach about morals is great, it really makes you think. He kinda has a point too. He shows one more time how mentally strong he is even tho he lacks physicial strength. This time is just on another level. Now lets talk about our new villain. KENYYYYYYYYYYY. I love this guy lol. The way he roasts and insults levi and the cowboy vibe he gives. I love it. He immediately showcases that he is not a joke by blowing nifa's head off just like that. He also seems very mysterious. The way he treats levi is almost as if he looks down upon him. Speaking of Levi here is what i think: That chase scene where he's running away from kenny is not just a great action sequence it also represents Levi running from his past. Kenny=His past. Running from kenny or his past. This arc is also big development and challange for him now that he has to act as a leader/commander because erwin is absent or busy. There was also some smaller developments for connie (motivating himself to take on the beast titan),jean (struggling to remain human which almost costs him life, also selfreflecting), sanes (showing how he didn't want to do the things that he has done and over the time he just got used to it, also he was kinda easy to symphatise with too and his devotion to king is may be morally wrong but aslo admirable, the way he feels destroyed after finding out that he was actually the one that betrayed the king is also worth mentioning), flegel (stepping up becoming a boss saying how he'll protect the people of his city), zachary (showcasing that he cares more about himself rather than humanity and how he always hated the governmant because they looked up on everyone).Enjoyment 10/10I never enjoyed AoT more. It's great.This season has perfect balance between story telling, character development and action.Overall 10/10

Shingeki No Kyojin has one of the best character developments and plot in history (note that this series does not have fill), he even the secondary and third characters have a great importance in the story, but also has that sense of terror, action and drama that by the way is incredibly well done, makes you live the situation that the characters go through and transmit their emotions to you in a very human way. It has an excellent background story that is simply memorable.Every decision they make is of minor importance to the series and should not be missed, their deaths and the surprise of knowing who are the real antagonists add a magical touchThe first season has a slight start, it ends up being a spectacular season, it is not the best but it is an amazing season with an incredible animation and plot, here you will be introduced to the first antagonist of the series. 9.4/10The second season I think was epic, this is when you start to see the faces of the real villains (get ready for Senshi Tmp 2 Ep 6 which according to me is the best of the second season, an overwhelming chapter) Shingeki no Kyojin explains it to you perfectly without leaving gaps in the plot, an incredible season. 9.6/10The third season is truly phenomenal, has a good start and lets you know the problems you will have in a society by not agreeing with something or the difficult decisions you must make to ensure your survival. After this, too many things are clarified without detours, the chapters that stood out most were Perfect Game (Tmp 3, Ep 16), Hero (Tmp 3, Ep 17), Midnight Sun (Tmp 3, Ep 18) and That Day (Tmp 3, Ep 20) (That day has no action or features our main characters, but this chapter amazes me, its development is spectacular and the way they explain everything is overwhelming, honestly, the best development chapter in the history of anime). 9.8/10Season four is the start of the finale. A season practically perfect, in this season everything comes to light answering every question of the viewer, leaves no gaps in the plot and has a beautiful animation, besides that is incredibly shocking and demonstrates the incredible development in our protagonists, Eren has the best character development I think. For me the best chapters were in my opinion Declaration of War (Tmp 4, Ep 5) (Declaration of War is one of the most impactful chapters of development), The War Hammer Titan (Tmp 4, Ep 6), Assault (Tmp 4, Ep 7), Assassin's Bullet (Tmp 4, Ep 7) (Assassin's Bullet left me speechless...) and Above and Below (Tmp 4, Ep 16), has not yet finished this season, but still for me it is spectacular. 9.9/ 10 This season is the best.In my opinion your average would be 9.3/10. Sincerely from my point of view, the best anime ever, a work of art from post-apocalyptic fiction.

The way it is animated, the soundtrack, the characters, the story, the thrill and the suspense. All in one action-packed anime. One of the best so far. As it has only 9 episodes as of now ... many critics say that it is way too early to rate an anime. But, according to me, this is pure class. The soundtrack's tempo varies according to the situation and this makes it more exciting. The ending of the episode is something that NO one will look forward to as NO one will want it to end. A must watch for every anime lover and of course the manga is available as well. Although a bit gory, the epicness makes up for it! You know those animes that catch your eye from the first episode, this is one of them.

It's exciting, it's mysterious, and it does a fantastic job of setting the tone.Season 2: 6/10This season is fine, it strays from the first season's tone a bit more than I'd like and it's full of conversations between major characters that the audience has zero context for, making this is a frustrating season to watch. On top of that, what should've been one of the show's biggest reveals is extremely downplayed to the detriment of the season.Season 3: 5/10I'm very mixed about this season. It's divided into two distinct arcs, the first of which is awful and the second of which is nearly the same level of quality as the first season. The structure and pacing of the first arc is terrible, the villains are bland and either not fleshed out at all or too late for the audience to care. The second arc of this season, however, is exciting and much more important to the overall narrative of the show. It still fails to perfectly recapture the tone of season one, but it's very good. The first arc is a 3/10 and the second if a 7/10, so rating-wise I took the average.Season 4: 6/10This season was difficult to get through for me, not because it was bad but because it was so different, There was so much information, and there were so many new characters and conflicts. It was a lot, but I think in the end it mostly worked. Not every new character or plot thread mattered in the grand scheme of things, while others mattered a lot and significantly impacted the narrative. The animation style was also very different this season and unfortunately it was to the show's detriment.Overall, I like this show a lot, but it has some significant problems. My biggest complaint was that the tone was set perfectly in season one, then largely abandoned for the rest of the series. Despite this, the show is exciting, the music and animation is (mostly) great, and the characters are well-realized and fun to watch.

 Ive been watching this show since 2016, and I wanted to write a review for it but I couldn't because with every new episode i have a mixed feelings and i can't determine where am i from this show. But now, with only 1 episode left, i can finally write whats in my heart.In AOT, you dont have to support the "good" against the "evil", because simply there's no such thing in this world. Usually, an any work whether if its a movie, tv show or an anime, there's sides and you as a viewer have the choice to support whatever you like good or bad. Most people choose the good side, some choose the bad one. This type of work represents almost 75% of all the works out there. So some of us have adjusted to the idea of good and bad sides.The other 25% are shows, movies and animes like AOT, they are psychologically complexed with a lot of twists and most importantly no good or bad sides. These kind of animes describes the world and our reality in such a scary truthful way, it mixes your emotions and feelings and you dont know what to think, makes you consider a thousand time before calling a character good or bad, this is AOT.After completing most of the show i can say, that AOT reached a high level of realism. That you dont have to determine in which side are you.One advice for anyone who hasn't saw AOT or is still in the beginning, dont take sides, just enjoy the anime because I believe its the best anime in the world.

And I understand why. The Plot is so well written, you won't even know the real storyline until season 3 or whatever. On the outside it seems a pretty simple story. Demons vs humans. Who will win? That is hardly the story at all... and even thinking that, I watched through the first 2 seasons. And even then I was hooked because of great story building and great great climaxes and actions and all. I thought season 1 ending was insane. Then season 2 came. I thought It was even crazier. Then season 3! A literal masterpiece... specially the second arc. and the 4th season is expected to be God Level. And I expect nothing less from the greatest anime of all time. That's how good the story is! It's complex yes. Greatest Plot I have ever seen on a show. I love breaking bad, I love Avatar the last air-bender, I love Game of thrones. But The story line, music, and the voice acting are all 10/10 easily. Do yourself a favor, don't judge it by it's cover, get through some quality anime till you reach God level story telling. You will thank me when you reach the season 3 finale, GUARANTEED!

building and plot. With ultra realistic consequences missing from a lot of animation, Attack on Titan stands out as it has an incredibly dark world with actually stakes. The aspects of horror and adrenaline when there's an action scene is stellar. The characters, action and music could carry episodes but don't have to because the show is already that good. Characters have depth and feel like real people, they die constantly and never feel 100% safe. The action is some of the best action in any show. Mystery aspects make even moments that could come off as bland feel so much more impactful. This is perhaps one of the best stories ever written. The Music makes this epic world feel vast and important, while also sounding phenomenal. Attack on Titan is a masterpiece of our generation and my favorite TV Show of all time.

time, its brilliant and its definitely the best tv show ive ever watched in my life. The fact that it has an imdb of 8.8 is a disgrace, it deserves way better than that especially after the glorious season 3 part 2. This anime is way better than rick and morty, way better than even game of thrones, but the ppl in charge of imdb give it a way lower ratings than those two?......balls. This anime deserves a lot more respect.

From the parallelisms with the real world depicting themes like war, greed, complacency, the inherit curiosity for exploration all the way to the grey characters and their respective development, I can only say good things about this anime.Ambiguity is an ever present concept in our lives, and this show depicts it like very few do, this associated with how brilliant the characters evolve throughout all 4 seasons its remarkable, you can empathize with someone that made the most awful things and that shows how brilliant the creator is.Adding to all the above, you will be facing many mind blowing twists and unexpected dark turns on the story, with one of the best animation work I've ever seen on screen, specially the most recent episodes - considering this started almost 10 years ago!Outstanding soundtrack, I get the chills on many of the fight scenes and of course it goes without saying that the fights themselves are brilliant, nerve wracking and make you so hyped with all of the elements of the action combined, really a one of a kind TV show.I am eagerly waiting for the final part next year I don't know if it wraps up badly but up until this point it's a flawless masterpiece and I don't say that lightly.EDIT AFTER SERIES FINALE:\nIt's quite the challenge to say the least to end a series like this one, after having watched the final episode I can safely reinforce how much of a masterpiece this anime is.... The message in the end transcends entertainment, it's a timeless lesson and it is scary how close to reality it is. It's almost impossible to get into detail without writing a full script so I'll leave it at this; this is one of the best TV shows ever created, don't take my word for it go binge it now that it wrapped up!

I had to pause S1E06 just now to write this review as 9 minutes into that episode had me crying again.I have been watching AoT since 2013, eagerly awaiting each new episode and season, and it's hard to believe the series is ending very soon. "Don't be sad that it's over, be happy that it happened", and all that...For a time my top 3 running shows were GoT, Vikings, and AoT. Sadly, GoT collapsed before the finish line, Vikings slowly fizzled out in quality after its fourth season, yet Attack on Titan has held strong and not only remained brilliant, but actually improved in many ways as the show progressed, which is incredibly rare.I still to this day listen to the amazing soundtrack while doing other things, and each time I return to watching the show, it's hard to pinpoint anything bad about it really. And I know some people will say that AoT is overrated, and I might have thought that at some points in the show also, such as at various points in Season 2 and 3, but when you see how it all connects together and makes overall sense in the macro, some seemingly weaker aspects or things that appear nonsensical, overly contrived or dramatized at the time, make sense upon revisiting it, or at least that was my experience.Anyway, I would give Attack on Titan a 10/10 simply because it is so intensely watchable, engaging, inspiring, epic, thought-provoking, anti-war, spine-chilling, horrifying at times, emotional and tear-inducing.If you liked the early seasons of Game of Thrones, Vikings, Breaking Bad, Fullmetal Alchemist, and other similar shows, then Attack on Titan is indeed for you.Now to slowly endure the agonising anticipation for each new and final episode of the last season...P.S. - a good companion documentary to this is Dominion (2018)

The feel this show gives is just awesome. I always want more of it and one episode a week is just so not fair. Right now I am on 20th episode and it's really getting better.The show hooked me from the very first episode. How action and emotions connects and make a perfect atmosphere for Titans, monsters who like to eat humans just for fun, and humans, fighting for their existence when stuck inside three walls.How main characters who aren't super powerful yet give a promising touch to the show. And how they show a real management work even when their is anger, fear and blood in the air.Characters are super cool and feel real unlike regular animes. This show is a guarantee of entertainment. Give it a try.

keeps me on the edge of my seat. Each week I watch and each week I want more. It's intense. The concept and story line are on point and keep you thrilled and wanting more. The only downside is the seven-day waiting for the next episode. Definitely one of the best anime I have seen. I often watch anime for fun and as a means of passing the time away but with this it's different. I can't tear my eyes away for even a second. A masterpiece in the making. I just hope the producers keep this running for longer instead of cutting it short into a 20-something episode thing such as SAO or BTOOOM!.Do yourself a favor and follow it.

                    Now that it's nearing it's part 1 ending, i'm so not okay. Binge-watched the whole show in a week or two and it's absolutely phenomenal. To be honest, i haven't even read a single chapter of AOT (Manga). And yet i've become a huge fan of this show. I'm waiting for part 1 to end (although i never wish it to end), so that i can read it completely all 33 Volumes. I could've read it before watching the anime but i hesitated. Because i wanted to know what it'd be like to watch this without reading the Manga.It's incredible how they managed to make it so special. This show is one of the greatest i have seen. I have watched almost 30 tv shows including Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones in the last couple of years. They were both an amazing show, had huge impact on viewers and general audiences. At the time, for me, GOT was the best of the best. But when i watched this, i'm kinda gradually giving it to AOT. Because it's perfect, every season and almost every episodes.Although i got a glimpse of what is to come in the next episode. But i didn't read it completely. Still waiting to read. Anyway, i can't wait for the next one, "Savagery" to come out. It's going to be beyond epic. I'm quite sure. I'd have rather rated this more than 10 if it was possible.(Season I : 9.3) (Season II : 9.7)(Season III : 9.8) (Season IV : 9.8)Musical Score : 100/100Characters : 105/100Animation : 99/100Story : 110/100.

The series is visually stunning in 3D and 2D animation with beautiful attention to detail. There is incredible world building, an engaging story line, music that serves as narration and a stellar voice cast. I give this series a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Steampunk Fantasy Adventure}

And, now having seen the whole first season, my rating remains even more solidly a 10! :-)Groundbreaking/beautiful animation, awesome environments, spectacular cinematography, cool musical choice, compelling characters, great voice casting/acting, and some interesting Sci-Fi/Fantasy lore! :-)YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS SHOW!!! :-)

The story is for everyone, but especially for League of Legends fans. The entire time I was watching it I was trying to piece together who is whom. And some of them are obvious but other ones really make you dig deep and see where they're trying to head.I truly believe this is a fantastic series, I love everything I've seen of it so far. 10/10 a complete knockout.

When i first turned this on and saw kids i immediately turned it off and sighed "not another kids show". But then i kept watching and realized this is not a kids show. It just has kids as characters. But wow it got dark and good.

I have been playing league since 2010, So my opinion may be a bit biased.But my parents were pleasantly surprised. They said that sometimes it was a little clear that this series is more aimed at a young adult audience. Some usage of the pop songs, and the villian being a little over the top mustace twirly.But overall they enjoyed the first 3 episodes and wouldn't mind watching the rest in their own time.As for me. I loved it! It was everything I hoped for and then some. Riot's art department was always on their A game. And with the track record from Fortiche I knew this had very little chance to blunder.Knowing Riot's art department it has an excellent story, well written charaters and a lore rich world to take elements from. All in all, this show comes together very nicely. And shows some of the best talents Riot has to offer.9/10: Amazing.

In the cities of Piltover and Zaun there is unrest, Piltover the upper city literally looks down on and oppresses Zaun. We have gangs of thieves, rebels, steampunk Stormtroopers, magic melded with science. This is serious stuff with great physical and "magic" fights. Also a tale of two sisters falling out and Scientist/Mages battling against the conservatism of the Council who fear the unleashing of uncontrollable powers. It's set in the League Of Legends game universe. Directed by Pascal Charrue and Arnaud Delord, written by Christian Linke and Alex Yee. 9/10.

The story was riveting and the pacing was perfect. And the amazing animation and soundtrack just enhanced the entire viewing experience. The VAs did an incredible job as well, particular the VA for Powder/Jinx.

In fact, I know almost nothing about it. But this show is fantastic. To say that the opening scenes of the first episode were "gripping" is an understatement. I don't often start on the edge of my seat with a TV show-- animated or live action.(UPDATE 1/14/2022: Rewatching the show for the second time and the opening scene still puts me at the edge of my seat, holding my breath. Wow.)The animation is well above average for a TV series. It's atmospheric in ways that most animated series don't even try. This isn't just another Star Wars-style animated series. It feels distinctly unique.The characters are also really interesting. Again, I know nothing about League of Legends. But based on the series description, I'm assuming at least a couple of these characters become a league champion? Ultimately, I have no idea what that really means. But I'm interested in finding out.And that's why I think this series is really successful. I don't know anything about the source material, but after just the opening scenes of the first episode, I'm invested in finding out more.10/10 easily. I would give it that score just for the first few minutes of the series alone.
## 9  Arcane has ended, and with that cemented itself in the history of television. It was no secret that this show was something special in the making after its 1st season, but after hearing it would conclude with season 2 I was sad yet exhilarated. The creators could've easily dragged this series on to make more money but decided to stick with their guns and end it on the terms they set.I wanted Arcane to be around 3-4 seasons long so the announcement of 2 was shocking to me given how much it took the world by storm in 2021. But it gave the creators the freedom to go all out with its final season and hold no punches, and I'm so glad to say it lived up to the hype.Season 1 of Arcane shattered boundaries by setting the stage perfectly with only 3 episodes, then proceeding to commit and deliver one of the best 1st seasons in TV history along with the likes of GOT, AOT and True Detective. The final season kept up the consistency, but did have more bumps than season 1. Despite that I still think it was a great experience that left me satisfied and happy once the story concluded.One of the best aspects of arcane is its animation. Studio Fortiche brought a whole new level of animation that can't be boxed into any category. It's a breath of fresh air and adds a unique look into this story. But I'd argue the the writing is what makes this show what it is. The writers can intertwine all of these different characters into the grand scheme of the story effortlessly, and despite it being the lesser of the 2 seasons I think the final season knocks down certain dominoes perfectly and adds genius parallels that I never expected. Alex Yee and Christian Linke deserve massive credit for being able to write these strong motivations and flesh them out for each character.While there are some all time great female characters in TV like Kim Wexler & Annalise Keating to name my favorites, it's not often when both leads of a show are female characters and are also written to near perfection. The dynamic of Violet & Powder is one of the best I've seen in television, and the performances of Hailee Steinfeld & Ella Purnell / Mia Sinclair Jenness only further invoke the emotional appeal of these characters that have so much depth in that regard. The execution from beginning to end with these two is great and is one of the many highlights of this series.If you're recommending a show to anyone, this has to be near the top of the list. Not because it's the best ever (even though the argument could be entertained) but due to the fact that it hooks you with an all time great TV episode just a couple of episodes in, and only has 2 seasons that give you little to no room to breathe. That along with the obvious facts of how well executed, acted and animated this show is. As much as I love Dark and BoJack Horseman, Arcane reigns supreme as Netflix's best show in my eyes and deserves to be talked about amongst the best tv series ever.

I would have given this series a 10/10, but...Season 2 ended up being a stark contrast to the emotionally gripping and well-crafted first season. The story felt chaotic and unfocused toward the end, making it hard to stay invested in what was happening. The characters, who were once unique and well-developed, gradually lost their individuality and became generic.One major issue was the attempt to give every character some sort of "redemption arc," creating the impression that no one was truly "bad." While this can work in some stories, here it felt like a forced attempt at a "Pixar-style philosophy" that ultimately fell flat. This undermined the conflicts and relationships that made the first season so compelling.Jinx, in particular, stood out as a major disappointment. In the first season, she was one of the most complex and captivating characters, but by the end of this season, she completely lost her spark. Her character felt ruined, which was especially disheartening given how central she was to the emotional weight of the story. Silco once said "I never would have given you to them. Not for anything. Don't cry. You're perfect." and I agree, she WAS perfect.Overall, Season 2 was a weak follow-up. Where the first season evoked strong emotions and made you deeply care about the characters, this one left only a faint impression. Expectations were high, but unfortunately, they weren't met.

Solid character development and world building means it's an entirely enjoyable watch without knowing anything about the game.The animation is outright exquisite. As an anime fan, I found the animation in Arcane to be leagues beyond anything I've ever seen from an animated series before. There is an incredible attention to detail. It's clear that no artistic talent or monetary expense was spared in bringing the world of Runeterra to life.Great soundtrack, great acting and a compelling story that doesn't pull any punches when it comes to violence and more adult themes.So far only the first three episodes have been released, and I can't wait to see what else they have in store for us!

The story between sisters, rich and poor, loyalty and betrayal, peace and war, and everything in between.There's a common saying that LoL's big budget went into animation instead of balancing the champions in game, and this couldn't be more right. I did not expect this masterful level of animation. After each episode, they found more ways to wow audiences with amazing visuals and transitions. The fighting scenes were hard-hitting and jaw-dropping.Even though the series wasn't fully canon to the original lore, it's still an intense story that set up an interesting universe. Not gonna lie, the first act didn't impress me too much, but episode 4 afterward got me entirely on board. My only problem with the story was that I just couldn't get enough of it. I wanted more and I don't like waiting.Just as cool as the animation was the characters. Many character dynamics fascinated me and made me realized how much I needed them. I'll admit that some characters were straightforward, but not all of them were predictable. Some still surprised me until the very end. The directions for all characters were incredible.Overall, even though the game was a love-hate relationship, Arcane was for sure all love, and a phenomenal step in setting up LOLCU. 8.5/10.

Normally, I wouldn't have paid attention to this series but considering the 9.4 on IMdB, I had to check out at least an episode to see what is so incredible about it. Starting of in a rather casual way, I wasn't too impressed with what I saw in that first episode, but the cliffhanger made me want to see what would happen next. Once I climbed that cliff, I was immersed into a fast paced steampunk world that had a lot to offer and many more cliffhangers to be experienced.The animation style of this series is best described as taking 6 buckets of paint, throwing them into a 10,000 volt transformer and stepping into the electrical blend of colors to be engulfed in the sheer awesomeness. As you adjust to this dynamic animation, you wilk see a story of an inventor, an underworld crime boss and a girl who wants to find her sister. All of these characters find themselves in the middle of a political intrigue that involves a utopian city and a rotten underbelly with it's social classes striving to achieve their goals by any means necessary. To top it off, there is plenty of emotional stuggle between family, friends and enemies.While all the technical, sound and visual aspects are second to none, it is the characters that made me want to come back to this series again and again. The show is irresistible to watch and the two reasons for that are the masterfully crafted intro that got me pumped in the beginning of each episode and the nail-biting cliffhangers that made me want to see hiw the story continues. Whether you like videogames or not, this show will grab your interest and won't let up until the final second. At that point, you will be anxiously waiting for season 2 which I hope will come very soon.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Show reviews.

I hope they make another season.

This is unique, gripping probably won't happen again like this! Phenomenal. Art is an anomaly; i don't get how but i know it is reality.

Every frame is a painting ready to fill a museum. The story, the characters, down to the little details. I laughed, I cried, and I wanted to be there for every moment.Give me more!

But it disappointed me as someone, who started watching it with high expectations. It has too many subplots and not all the characters' storylines continue to be well-thought out. Starting from episodes 6 and 7, it became too abstract for my taste and I lost interest little by little. One character, whose role was not well developed in this season is Heimerdinger. It has lots of unused potential. The issue is more fundamental: with so much potentials created in Season 1, unfortunately, many get simply lost in the network of weird interaction storylines of Season 2. Wasn't worth the time.

Character development is impressive for every single major character. Many of the characters are morally grey in a realistic way. Most shows are lucky to get a few characters that go through good character development arcs- in Arcane we get to see all the main characters develop and it's never forced or unrealistic. Overall, Arcane is a masterclass in world-building and character writing. This puts most other television shows to shame in the intensity and detail of its story, and will be remembered as a staple in the development and adaptation of modern fantasy for years to come. I'm really looking forward to season 2.
