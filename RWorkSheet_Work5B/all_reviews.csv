NA,"","Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2024","Previous page","Surprising yield per fill.  Set and forget, either bin full of ice or out of water, it will automatically pause with appropriate indicating light showing status.  We don't even leave it on our counter all the time...one day operation will give us as much or more ice as our usually purchased 10 lb sacks at the grocery would.  Considering that our rather small, rural store charges well over $3 for one of those, the maker will indeed pay for itself before long.  Another thing to enjoy is how easy it is to keep the pieces separated one from another, since there is little excess water involved instead of the melt during trips back from grocery to home.And although the quite small pieces at first give the impression that it will take forever to get much ice out of the process, I timed a few of the start to finish batches (just 6 pieces) and it really is only 6 minutes.  Walk away, ignore it for a while, and from morning to evening, a few bin emptying moments - and who doesn't walk into their kitchen several times a day, anyway - which take seconds leave enough ice to last as long or longer than those 10 lb sacks.  Every bit as good as advertised.","","Yes"

My bad. But this one doesn't have that sensor glitch like a lot of them do. Makes great ice and is reliable!! Don't bother with the cheaper ones. They have this sensor glitch that tells the machine it's full when it's not. Therefore you never get a full basket of ice. This one fills full and works amazing!!

NA,"","Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2024","Previous page","This product has been great to use and solves the small-scale ice problemThere is a lot of attention to detail in the design and performance that work well.  For instance, the electronic sensors eliminate the mechanical ice sensor that would be prone to breakage or just being in the way. The upright footprint works well fitting under cabinets wile minimizing counter spaceSome caveats from my experience.1 the first ice is ice, but not super cold ice ‚Äî if you put it in a room temp drink it melts quickly.  I recommend letting it run to let the first ice cool the chamber.  I often put cold water in it give some cooling to the chamber2 even the large cubes are small and hollow. That means high surface area which is both an advantage and disadvantage3 note that this device isn‚Äôt really going to supply a group with ice. It‚Äôs great for two.4 it does put some warm air (it must to work).  So, put it on the covered porch if that is a problem5 I find it perfect for the RV. I crank it up first thing and ice is ready just about when I am!  Nothing like ice in your drink when it‚Äôs hot out.  Or for a margarita!6 it is (obviously) sensitive to ambient temp.  It produces much more ice it‚Äôs cool and the water you add is cool.7 many of these ice makers look basically identical, perhaps from the same factory.

My freezer stopped making ice and I got tired of running out to buy bags so I thought I'd give this a shot. It works pretty well and fast! As other reviewers have mentioned, use the large setting and get them in your freezer as soon as possible. Fresh out of the machine they will melt pretty quickly, but once they've been in the freezer for an hour or so, they work exactly the same as ""regular"" ice cubes. If you're on the fence, definitely go ahead and buy it.","","Yes"

(Black)","EUHOMY Countertop Ice Maker Machine with Handle","Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2024","4.4 out of 5 stars","I recently purchased a countertop icemaker for my kitchen, and I must say, it has been a game-changer. This compact appliance has exceeded my expectations in terms of convenience, efficiency, and overall performance.First and foremost, the countertop icemaker is incredibly convenient. Gone are the days of constantly refilling ice trays and waiting hours for them to freeze. With this icemaker, I can have a fresh batch of ice cubes in as little as 6-8 minutes. This means I never have to worry about running out of ice when hosting parties or enjoying a cold drink on a hot day. The convenience of having a steady supply of ice readily available at my fingertips is truly invaluable.In terms of efficiency, this countertop icemaker is a standout. It is capable of producing a significant amount of ice in a short period of time. With a large water reservoir and a high ice production capacity, I can easily make up to 26 pounds of ice per day. This is more than enough for my daily needs and ensures that I always have plenty of ice on hand. Additionally, the icemaker is energy-efficient, utilizing minimal power to produce ice, which is a great feature for keeping energy costs low.The performance of the countertop icemaker is impressive. It produces clear, well-formed ice cubes that are perfect for a variety of uses, from chilling drinks to filling up ice buckets. The icemaker also offers different ice cube sizes, allowing me to choose between small or large cubes depending on my preferences. The ice cubes are consistently produced and the machine operates quietly, without causing any disturbance in the kitchen. I appreciate the ease of use and reliability of this appliance.Another notable feature of the countertop icemaker is its compact size and sleek design. It takes up minimal space on my countertop and blends seamlessly with my kitchen decor. The lightweight and portable design also make it easy to move the icemaker around if needed. Whether I'm using it in the kitchen, taking it on a camping trip, or using it for outdoor events, the countertop icemaker is versatile and convenient to use in any setting.Maintenance of the icemaker is also hassle-free. The machine is equipped with a self-cleaning function, which helps keep it clean and free from any buildup or odors.

The simple control panel and user-friendly interface make operating the icemaker a breeze, even for those who are not tech-savvy.Overall, I highly recommend the countertop icemaker to anyone in need of a reliable and efficient ice-making solution. Its convenience, efficiency, and performance make it an essential appliance for any kitchen or entertaining space. Say goodbye to ice trays and hello to a constant supply of ice cubes with this countertop icemaker. It's a game-changer that will elevate your ice-making experience to new heights.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Yes"
"","","Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2024","Previous page of related Sponsored Products","This is my 2nd Euhony ice maker. The 1st one was almost exactly like this one except it was silver and it didn't have a handle. It was a good ice maker and lasted 2 years, then one day it just up and died. I never had a countertop ice maker before so I don't know how long they are suppose to last, but 2 years seems about right, considering the reasonable price and I ran it continuously from the 1st time it was turned on with no problems or complaints until the moment it died....The only issue I had was I used tap/fawcett water from the city to make the ice cubes and mineral deposits such as lime would get built up in the reservoir and it required constant cleaning. But, that was not the fault of the ice maker. That was my fault for using tap/fawcett water from the city. Now that I think about it, the lime deposits might have had something to do with why it stopped working after 2 years...This black one, I'm planning on using nothing but bottled water, and I used it to make ice cubes for the 1st time today. The ice cubes came out real nice looking and firm and crunchy. They look like ice, tastes like ice, they're cold as ice, and they chill my lemonade, just the way I like for them to do. What's not to like? It will be interesting to see how long this one lasts. That will probably be the determining factor which ice maker I like best, this one or the 1st one. I'm giving it 5 stars because so far I have nothing to complain about.","","Yes"

NA,"","Reviewed in Saudi Arabia on June 10, 2024","Previous page","The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because of the consistency of the ice cubes and how quickly they CAN melt. Otherwise I really enjoy this little machine. It isn't so massive that I can't have it out on the counter. It DOES make a decent amount of ice and overall (unlike many of thr reviews I read) it doesn't take a ton of care. If you don't use alot of ice throughout the day you can easily put the ice in a baggie and into a freezer for use later. If you let the ice sit it will melt your ice until it pushes the water back in from the melted cubes to make more. I mention ice cubes consistency because it is a smaller unit so the runnier/meltier ice cubes happen occasionally of the ice isn't being used regularly. The only other downfall is cleaning the machine. I don't like to tip it (my understanding is that is a no go for products with refrigerant?) So it is harder to get all the old water out to clean the machine. I use vinegar for a cleaning process. My machine is used daily for months now, with no issues (no leaking, issues powering on, issues producing ice, etc.) It has a hum and ""ice drop"" sounds to it but nothing i can imagine would keep you up at night.. Also makes ice quickly!","","Yes"

NA,"","Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2024","Previous page of related Sponsored Products","After two years and two months of daily use, through two summers in the Deep South at a house with a pool, with guests for all the usual holidays AND including a full year as the sole ice maker for an adult couple...the fan quit.For about the last month it had been giving indications that something wasn‚Äôt normal.  After 44 years of marriage, pattern recognition becomes a finely honed survival skill, so when a machine in the kitchen starts acting up you tend to notice it. This past Sunday afternoon I was dozing on the sofa ignoring the TV when this ice maker made a unique noise that woke me up. I can‚Äôt describe the actual noise it made (I was dreaming, I swear it shouted something at me) but it was weird enough that I went to check on it. The ice in the bin had melted, the back of the unit felt hot, and the fan wasn‚Äôt running. I quickly unplugged the machine without paying attention to the status lights (so unfortunately I don‚Äôt know what was displayed) and positioned a small desk fan blowing into the rear vent to cool it down. After 30 minutes I re-powered the unit and it started making ice again, except the exhaust fan was dead.I unplugged and drained it, then removed the rear cover (five screws on the bottom) and used the external fan for cooling to verify the ice maker still worked otherwise, which it did. The fan would start if I gave it an assist, but would not run full speed and would not restart on its own. After several hours I was confident a new fan would fix it.Exact replacement fans are plentiful and inexpensive here on everyone‚Äôs favorite home shopping site, just search for the part number printed on the fan motor. For $17 a new fan arrived overnight. Removing the fan from the radiator is super easy (two obvious screws) however unplugging the fan from the controller board and fishing the power wire out with plug intact is extremely difficult. The controller board is mounted inside a plastic box, and getting the cover off the box without full disassembly requires a lot of cussing, needle nosed pliers, and at least one skinned knuckle. Once the controller cover is off, the fan‚Äôs power plug had a glob of hot glue covering it and the socket, and the wire was tie-wrapped in a spot that I couldn‚Äôt even see at first. The manufacturer doesn‚Äôt intend for you to remove this, and if you‚Äôre not careful you‚Äôll break the socket off the board or something else. There's lots of wires all bundled together, easy to mess up.If I were to do this again I‚Äôd simply cut the wires to the old fan, careful to leave as much length as possible, and splice in the new fan using small wire nuts, or solder and shrink wrap if you prefer. Be sure to clean the dust from the backside/inlet side of the radiator (internal, facing the compressor) using a soft bristle toothbrush. Mine was completely blocked by dust, which is what caused the fan to fail in the first place. This unit does not have an air filter, so if you live in a dusty environment and/or have pets you probably need to open it up and clean the radiator once a year. Before you put the cover back on, blow the whole thing out with compressed air or a leaf blower.As to cleaning the actual ice making ‚Äúwet‚Äù section of this model, I use a hand held steam gun with a flexible nozzle about three times a year and it keeps it clean as new inside. No need for running vinegar through it, it‚Äôs not like a coffee pot and doesn‚Äôt develop calcium deposits. I use a mild bleach solution for running the built in cleaning cycle while blasting the top out with the steam gun, then thoroughly rinse out the whole thing using the sink hand sprayer. The mold/slime that will develop in the top of the unit comes from exposure to room air. Like most ice makers I‚Äôve ever owned, it‚Äôs difficult if not impossible to access the actual ice tray section to hand clean it. AND every ice maker I‚Äôve ever owned will develop mold wherever it‚Äôs regularly exposed to room temperature air, so the complaints I‚Äôve read about this unit are not unique to this unit. If your refrigerator has an ice & water dispenser in the door, I discourage you from looking at it too closely with a flashlight or you‚Äôll stop using it.Anyway, the unit has been cleaned and reassembled and making ice again like it was new. While this particular machine has not been subjected to vibration like it might be in a motor home, or rough handling from potable use, it has run for over two (2) years continuously, sometimes needing multiple tank refills per day. I subtract one star for being moderately difficult to repair, but I‚Äôd give it 10 stars if I could for being a great value for the money.","","Yes"
NA,"","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2024","Next page of related Sponsored Products","Bought this to replace a Magic Chef ice maker that made the same amount of ice. That one lasted for a little over 2 years so looking forward to seeing how long this one will last. The overall size is a tad bit smaller than our old one. That is both good and bad. This one is a bit shallower where the ice collection basket sits. So far the only down side I‚Äôve found is that when scooping ice from a full basket, it tends to push a cube or two back 8 to the drop chute. This is a small problem, not worth worrying too much about. It makes ice quickly, is relatively quiet and works pretty much like every other version of this variety. It only has 1 size setting for cube size but it makes the larger size cubes. I never used the small size on my other one. I also like the fact that you can get to the freezing apparatus a bit easier for cleaning when needed. Overall it‚Äôs a nice little ice maker.TIPS: when using this type of ice maker, fully expect the ice to melt slowly. The ice basket is NOT refrigerated. It sits over an ice bath that will chill after it‚Äôs been running for an hour or so. When you first turn it on, the ice cubes it makes will be very small as the water chills. Each successive batch that drops, about every 7 minutes or so, will get bigger as the water bath chills. I recommend dumping the first 3 or 4 drops of ice, back into the water reservoir. This will speed up the water chilling and make bigger ice cubes faster.","Really Cranks Out The Ice","Yes"
NA,"","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","4.3 out of 5 stars","I am amazed at how rapidly this makes ice. I fill it with refrigerated and filtered water from our fridge and it starts spitting out ice into its bin within minutes and doesn‚Äôt stop until the bin is full. A full tank of water fills the bin at least twice. As others have noted, the ice is slightly wet by the time the bin is filled (due to slight melting) so I transfer the ice in the full bin to a plastic bag and put the bag in the freezer while the second batch is being made. When the second batch is done, I take the bag out of the freezer, whack it on the counter a couple times to break up the ice, and transfer the now fully frozen ice to the ice compartment in my freezer. I then refill the bag with the contents of the full bin and repeat the above steps (bag in freezer for 20-30 minutes, whack on counter, transfer ice to freezer ice bin). BTW, I‚Äôd suggest gently shaking the bin as you lift it out of the machine to get rid of excess water before you transfer the ice to a bag. The noise level is not at all excessive but you will hear the fan whirring and the ice tumbling into the bin. There is a drainage plug on the bottom so you can drain remaining water from the unit without tipping it over. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and surprised at the performance of this ice maker, particularly at this price point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Yes"

NA,"","Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2024","4.3 out of 5 stars","I did not realize that if the water wasn't relatively cold, or if the area you have the machine in is too warm that it doesn't actually make good ice cubes. It makes a lot of ice very quickly when it's not too hot in the room where the machine is located, or the water is not too warm that goes into the machine... I have found putting refrigerated water in the machine produces good results. Most of these small ice machines are not miniature freezers so you must take the ice cubes out relatively soon after they're made. (After the basket fills up) I put them in a plastic bag and put them in the freezer once they are refrozen and not wet I just break up the bag of cubes against a hard surface.Overall I like this machine very much.

We do have multiple kids playing sports and my wife and I keep larger water bottles for hydration during the day.  We needed more ice, but not a commercial ice maker in the.  I was looking for a machine that would fit under by cabinet on the counter garage and didn‚Äôt want to spend $500 plus for the extra ice.  I wanted as much capacity and production capacity in a small space.  I also love small nugget ice that I get at some restaurants, and I get larger cube ice from my fridge.  In our house the machine runs a lot during the day, because we all prefer this chewable small cube ice over the larger cubes.The machine makes noise because it has a compressor to cool the water.  I like that I can hear it so that I know when it needs more water, or I need to empty the ice tray.  It is a low hum when it is running.If you keep it full of water and off load the ice this thing can produce a lot of extra ice.  It fills up surprisingly quick.  When we are home we run it all day.  Cleaning is extremely easy, and doing so keeps the ice flowing.  We have sported every weekend it seems, we always have ice for our small coolers.  This crushed Ice is great because it fills small cracks and gives you maximum surface area on what you are trying to cool down.I had a minor issue with my machine.  I contacted support and got prompt answers and they are a great help.  It is so refreshing working with a small business that stands behind their product and want to ensure that you love their product.  There is a reason they have so many high reviews.Tips/Notes- Don't bother buying the fancy amazon cleaning solutions.  Run the clean cycle with vinegar, drain, then run the clean cycle with water to flush, drain, and back to making ice.- As with every ice maker, it will think it is full before it is truly full.  You can either transfer it at that point or move it from the middle and allow it too full up.- The ice bin is slightly insulated, but it is not a freezer.  The ice will eventually melt back to the water tank below and keep re-making the same ice.  Try not to burn up electricity and the machine by trying to run it 24/7.- We run it while we are home and transfer the excess to the freezer.  Then turn it off when we leave.- Since the ice is not made and stored in a freezer, it is not what I would call hard frozen.  So, you cannot just dump it to your ice tray in the freezer because it will clump.  I fill up a gallon bag and then once it is hard frozen I move to my ice tray.  Steady flow of ice now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Yes"

Hated the bullet bc I really wanted the nugget but no one sold it yet. Bought the joy pebble brand nugget and after 1 week started to make an awful high pitch grind noise sounded like a donkey. Returned it. Then bought this one and so far so good I‚Äôve only had it for one day. The ice is exactly like chick fil an and sonic. It‚Äôs perfect and safe chewing ice for kids pets and me. No choking on hard big cubes. I‚Äôm praying to God almighty my savior in Heaven that this machine doesn‚Äôt make any weird noises. So far there is some regular low noise when the ice is being dispensed and then a little bit louder low regular noise for 15 seconds or less after the ice is completed dispensing. I can deal with that no prob. I will update my rating if I end up returning. Pray for my ice machine to stay relatively quiet please!UPDATE!  I changed my review from 4 to 5 stars bc the louder noise it was making for 15 seconds was the water being sucked into the ice making mechanism and there wasn‚Äôt enough water in the reservoir. The louder noise has stopped.I rushed over to the machine when it was making the louder noise, lifted the ice basket up and saw it sucking the water up needing more water.  Problem solved!Still praying for no grinding noise. So far so good. Will continue to update as things change.","","Yes"

The packing materials that the fridge arrives in are standard for short-distance travel, i.e., from the store, to the car, to the kitchen....but they are not meant for long-distance shipping and the result is cosmetic damage. Once the shipping materials are more robust, then moving forward, this won't be an issue.I was contacted by a seller representative and she has been absolutely sensational in assisting me.  I received a genuine note of apology from the rep, on behalf of the seller.The representative offered me a choice to replace the fridge at no cost to me or to receive a full refund.  This says a great deal about the seller's high-marked level of integrity and it displays an exceptionally grand level of customer service.  It's clear that the seller values each of their customers and that they stand behind the products they sell. This means more to me than I can say, considering that money is scarce these days.  I can feel safe about continuing to purchase products from this specific seller - which is exactly what I'm doing today, in fact!!  Thank you for everything, Nora!!!The fridge works VERY well and the space inside is surprisingly ample. The freezer compartment is large enough to accomodate a pack of chicken thighs, an ice tray, an ice pack, bone-in pork chops, AND a small container of frozen stock!!  The freezer also comes equipped with adjustable temp control.  The main fridge is also very, very roomy - there's a veg crisper that holds LOTS of veggies, a canned drink/bottle storage, adjustable shelves, and places for jars, cheeses, etc. The temp is always perfectly chill.There is no mechanical noise or humming, whatsoever.  Absolute quiet.  I was concerned about noise, too.  But this is perfectly quiet.  Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the performance of this fridge and you will be too!!  PS This fridge comes in some really amazing color choices, too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Yes"
"","","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2024","Previous page of related Sponsored Products","Not gonna lie. We bought this particular fridge strictly because it fits perfectly with my wife's baby blue New Orleans decorating scheme at the weekend place. Never heard of the manufacturer, so that was a leap of faith. And I suspect that we paid a premium for the color (which is actually rather nice).This is our ""adult beverages"" fridge and it holds nothing else, so I can't comment on how well it packs and keeps veggies or meat. The freezer is a tiny joke, same as every other mini-fridge, and we only use it for m'lady's frozen Almond Joys. My only quibble, and it is very minor, is that there is a noticeable 'clunk' sound when the compressor kicks on. Very quiet otherwise. We're quite pleased with this purchase.","","Yes"

NA,"","Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2023","Next page","I had a lot of reservations about this fridge before I bought it that were caused by the bad reviews I read.A lot of people complained about dents and scratches, and I was worried that I would suffer the same fate. However, I lucked out. The fridge arrived upright in an undented box, thank goodness. And I noticed a protective tape-like film covering the fridge itself when I took it out of the box.Pulling all that tape/film off wasn't fun. But I think it's safe to say most of us would rather do that than deal with a scratched-up fridge.As for lifting it, I'm a proud geezer (50+), and I was able to put it on a dolly and carry it to the kitchen by myself, pick it up, and put it on a counter by myself without experiencing any pain.To paint a picture, the whole process took about as much effort/strength as it does for me to carry a big bag of pet food or cat litter from the front door to the kitchen. However, I don't have any health or mobility issues that prevent me from lifting <40 lbs. And this fridge weighs about 40 lbs., so get help if you need it.In terms of performance, thus far, I am very pleased with how it's working. I let it sit up, unplugged, for about seven hours to let the compressor oil settle. And I got very nervous after I plugged it in and noticed the top and sides got very warm. But I've learned that that's normal.It's expelling heat, so the exterior cools off when the inside finally gets cold.As for how cold the inside gets, I've opted to set the thermostat to four because I don't have air conditioning and I don't want to overwork the compressor. Plus, four gets the job done for me.My bottled water, leftovers, and produce were/are cold. I also put some bottled water in the chiller rather than use the ice tray that came with the fridge because it's too tiny IMO. And the bottles I put in the chiller got nice and frosty, but they didn't freeze. And it does say in the manual that the chiller is not a freezer, and you shouldn't keep anything in it for more than a few days. So I don't expect to have bottles of ice when I use it. However, cranking the thermostat up to five might turn them into slush.In terms of noise, I noticed some customers complained and said the noise disturbed them. Mine does not make a lot of noise, just a very low hum, which might be annoying if you're extremely sensitive to sound and are in the same room for prolonged periods of time.Neither situation applies to me. So all things considered, I'm a happy camper right now. But I will be updating this review if things change any time soon.","Spacious and practical for a tiny fridge","Yes"

After reading many reviews and watching user videos, I decided on this one for its cost, ease of use and cleaning, ice production, and small size for sitting on the countertop. We use a lot of ice and our fridge ice maker does not work well sadly. We waited the recommended 24 hours, leaving the machine upright in the box. Then we loaded it with water, plugged it in, and pressed the button; it began making ice within 6 minutes. (we tossed the first 5 batches or so as rec.) It has a slight hum when it is on, but nothing bothersome to us. Some say this ice cannot be frozen, or it turns into a block of ice, but we figured out a way that works for us. Once the ice basket is full, we dump the ice in a bin in our freezer. After we get a good amount of ice in the bin, we break it up with an ice pic We may have to do this a couple of times, but we are ok with that for the amount of ice we can produce over a few hours.This is our second Silon ice machine. The first one turned on but never made ice. We returned with no hassle and ordered the one we now have. It just must have been a bad machine. We are thankful the return was easy.","","Yes"

This machine makes tiny little ice cubes. I think that would be my only complaint is that they're not crushed ice cubes. Other than that, it works well and it arrived quickly. It might be a good idea to change the description or update it as to not mislead others who are looking specifically for crushed ice as we were.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Yes"

NA,"","Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2024","Next page","Received ice maker May 9th. The ice maker starts making ice very quickly that‚Äôs by far the best thing about it. The basket is tiny tho.  The shavings that come out first if the ice maker has not been on long taste very bad to say the least (& that was my favorite part of my previous ice maker). The main problem I have is the ice is very hard & the ice maker does not fill up as shown in the photos I‚Äôm uploading. It also kicks off and on constantly which makes me think I‚Äôm wearing it out so I keep it off a lot more than I would prefer to. It is very noisy as other reviews state. I do use it frequently & no issues yet or nastiness which js always an issue with ice makers but I do wish it was a little larger & had a better basket system where the ice didn‚Äôt just pile up & shut it down so quickly.Update. It‚Äôs now July 24th & it‚Äôs not working properly. It is now taking all day to make one basket of ice and has the death squeal part time. I would not recommend.","","Yes"
